# Problem Statement — Study Habit Tracker

Many students struggle to maintain consistent study routines, resulting in poor academic performance, unfinished tasks, and lack of progress tracking. Traditional methods such as notebooks or mobile reminders are often inefficient, easy to forget, and do not provide a structured way to analyse study patterns.

To address this issue, the *Study Habit Tracker* project aims to provide a simple, digital, and user-friendly solution that helps students monitor and improve their daily study habits.

## 🎯 Project Aim

The aim of this project is to create a web-based application that allows students to:

- Record daily study sessions  
- Track subjects and time spent  
- Review recent activity  
- Build productive study habits  
- Analyse their own learning consistency  

This helps students stay organised and accountable in their academic journey.
